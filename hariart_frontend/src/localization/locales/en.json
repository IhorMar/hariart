  "about.p1": "On this website, we are offering framed canvas painting of three different varieties, windows to the spiritual world, a variety of vedic art, and landscape pictures.",
  "about.p2": "Our primary collection is paintings from another world. Paintings of Krishna are like windows to the spiritual world; it means that through these paintings, we are looking into the ‘real world,’ which means that within seconds we can easily be transported from this world to the spiritual world. A world where every step is a dance and every word is a song. Where Radha and Krishna have transcendental pastimes that go on eternally.",
  "about.p3": "Just like Krishna is none different from His name, so when you chant the names of Krishna, He is present in that sound. In the same way, Krishna is non-different from His picture. Having a painting of Krishna in your front room would mean that He is personally present.",
  "about.p4": "In this world, everything has a beginning and an end, so why not transport yourself to another world. There is no need for a passport, visa, or the expense of a galactic travel fee. Bring Krishna to your home at an affordable price.",
